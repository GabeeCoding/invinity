todo list:

FIRST, setup PWA and service worker and caching and all that good stuff, maybe some integration with the build system would be cool too

- PWA setup and cache everything (DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: functions for that, store everything in a db)
	- non-pwa mode should use db too
- instance selector, settings page
- instance rotator
- offline music downloads
- offline playlists
- import/export data (entire db?)
